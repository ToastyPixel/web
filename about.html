<p>Hey! I go by <strong>Femiew</strong> online. I like making programs, tinkering with electronics, and generally poking at tech until it does something cool.</p>

<p>At home I run a small Proxmox setup (it’s literally a laptop, lol) to host useful stuff—like network-wide ad blocking with <strong>Pi-hole</strong>. It’s hooked up to a gigabit switch too, so it’s got that <em>zoomie network</em> energy.</p>

<p>I’ve done a bunch of projects over time: I’ve hosted Minecraft servers (not up anymore… RIP), messed around with NAS software like <strong>TrueNAS</strong>, and ran a Discord bot for a while. I’ve also built computers for myself and other people, and I’m always experimenting with something new.</p>

<p>I’m also a huge Minecraft tinkerer—messing with server setups, plugins, and mods. I’ve played around with things like <strong>PaperMC</strong> and <strong>Fabric</strong>, and I love tweaking everything until it runs smooth and feels just right.</p>

<p>And yes… I still love <strong>Minecraft Beta 1.7.3</strong> for that old-school vibezzz. Something about the classic look and feel just hits different.</p>

<p>One of my favorite “because I can” projects was running a Minecraft server on a <strong>2008 iMac</strong>… which eventually died (RIP). I ran <strong>Arch Linux</strong> on it and even used it as my main PC for a bit just to see how slow it really was—turns out that old <strong>Core 2 Duo</strong> was kind of a beast. I don’t remember the GPU, but let’s just say it <em>kinda</em> worked for Minecraft, and honestly that’s impressive. I also repurposed it as a little NAS for a while, and it was actually great for that.</p>

<p>I run Linux on my main PC too. Right now it’s an <strong>i5-4590</strong> with <strong>24GB RAM</strong> and a <strong>GTX 750</strong>. I’m planning to upgrade to an <strong>i7-4790</strong> and a <strong>GTX 1650</strong> eventually… but honestly with RAM prices sometimes I’d rather just buy gold instead.</p>

<p>I’ve experimented with <strong>Tor</strong> too—ran relays and hosted a few small sites on Tor for fun and learning. Tor is a really cool project and I respect what it does, but I don’t host anything there anymore and I’m not running relays these days.</p>

<p>Any programs I make are always free to use—because free is cool, and sharing projects is part of the fun.</p>

<p>I think thats it for now date december 19th 2025</p>
