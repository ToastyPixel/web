<p><strong>Agree</strong> is a lightweight Minecraft server plugin that makes sure players read and accept your rules before they can play.</p>

<p>When a player joins, a clean chest-style GUI opens automatically. A book in the center shows your custom message (rules, info, warnings, terms — whatever you need). On the sides are two buttons: accept and deny. Both button names are fully configurable, so you’re not stuck with “Agree” and “Deny”.</p>

<p>If a player accepts, the GUI closes, they’re allowed to play, and you can send them a custom chat message. If they deny, they’re kicked instantly with a configurable disconnect message.</p>

<p>All text supports classic <code>&amp;</code> color codes: the GUI title, book message lines, button names, accept message, and kick message.</p>

<p><strong>Agree</strong> is perfect for rule popups, performance warnings, or any “you must accept this to play” agreement that should appear every time a player joins.</p>
